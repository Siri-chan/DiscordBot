# DiscordBotTest
A simple test bot program written in c# with dsharpplus. 
## Setup
For this to work you need to create a file titled config.json in `/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.x` that reads 
```
{
	"token": "<insert here>",
	"prefix": "<insert here>",
}
```
Then, compile it with Microsoft .NET.
## Commands
### qcredits
**Syntax:** `qcredits <page>`  
**Conditions:** Requires an Integer to take the place of the `page` variable. Page 1 = General Credits; Page 2 = Source Code  
**Description:** Information about the bot.
